# RapaportProject
Front end:

I created an array in Redux to keep all the data I get from the server.
And any data I add will be adding to both the array in Redux and the file in  the server.
I used UseEffect to create calls to the server (Get and Post).
I wrote a function to calculate the statistics I used JS 'reduce function.
I did validation tests on the fields and other tests that were necessary.
I made an option that when the number is decimal it would cut me the unnecessary digits.
And also in the numbers when commas are missing â€”> then put them.

Back end:

I implemented Swagger in my project.
I set the .csv file in its property to be permanent.
I did a get call to get all diamonds from the .csv file.
And a post call when adding a new diamond from the client.
